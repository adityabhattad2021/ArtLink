# ArtLink

ArtLink is a platform that aims to empower artists in the age of AI-generated artwork. The platform allows artists to upload their artwork, and users can train AI models using the uploaded artwork to generate variations or styles. These AI-generated variations can be minted as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and traded in the marketplace. ArtLink ensures that artists receive a share of the profits from the sales of AI-generated NFTs, providing them ongoing revenue even if the NFTs are not entirely their original creations.
